class RazorpayClient:
    """
    A client class for interacting with the Razorpay payment gateway.

    This class provides methods to create and manage Razorpay orders for payment processing.
    It uses the Razorpay Python SDK client to communicate with Razorpay's API.

    Usage Example:
    -------------
    # Initialize the client
    razorpay_client = RazorpayClient()
    
    # Create a new order
    order = razorpay_client.create_order(
        amount=299900,    # â‚¹2,999.00 (amount in paise)
        currency="INR"
    )

    Attributes:
        None - Uses the globally configured Razorpay client

    def create_order(self, amount, currency):
        """
        Creates a new order in Razorpay for payment processing.

        This method creates a new order with the specified amount and currency using
        the Razorpay API. The order can then be used to initiate payment collection
        from the customer.

        Args:
            amount (int): The payment amount in smallest currency unit 
                         (e.g., paise for INR, cents for USD)
            currency (str): The 3-letter currency code (e.g., "INR", "USD")

        Returns:
            dict: The created order details from Razorpay containing:
                - id: The unique order ID
                - entity: Always "order"
                - amount: The order amount
                - currency: The order currency

        This method validates that a payment was legitimately processed through Razorpay
        by verifying the cryptographic signature. This is a crucial security step to
        prevent payment tampering.

        Args:
            razorpay_payment_id (str): The unique payment ID from Razorpay
